# [Ring Buffer](ring-buffer/)
A simple implementation of a **Ring Buffer** or what's also known as **Circular or Cyclic Buffer**.

# [Sliding Window](sliding-window/)
Scala Seq[A] has a great method called [**sliding**](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/Seq.html) which groups elements in fixed size blocks by passing a "sliding window" over them (as opposed to partitioning them.) So I wanted to implement something similar in Java.

# [List Zip](list-zip/)
Another nice feature of Seq[A] are the [**zip, zipWithIndex**](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/Seq.html) methods which combines elements from Seq(s) into a Seq of tuples (or pairs.) So I wanted to implement something similar in Java.
