# [Ring Buffer](ring-buffer/)
A simple implementation of a **Ring Buffer** or what's also known as **Circular or Cyclic Buffer**.

# [SLiding Window](sliding-window/)
Scala Seq[A] has a great method called **[sliding(size: Int, step: Int): Iterator[Seq[A]]**](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/Seq.html) which groups elements in fixed size blocks by passing a "sliding window" over them (as opposed to partitioning them.) So I wanted to implement something similar in Java.
